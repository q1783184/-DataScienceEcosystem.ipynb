# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# **Objectives:**
- Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples
- Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
- Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries
- Create a markdown cell to list data science languages
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. python
2. Java
3. R
# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
| Data Science Tools |
| ------------------ |

| R studio |
### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200//60
